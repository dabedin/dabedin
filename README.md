### About me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dabedin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything Azure, Dapr, .NET and microservices architecture
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new things about Dapr, .NET but I'm curious about Python and JS --- mainly in the Home automation space
- :technologist: Playing with [GenAI recently](https://github.com/dabedin/ai-de-camp), blown away by the power of [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
- âš¡ I authored ["Practical Microservices with Dapr and .NET" 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Microservices-Dapr-NET-cloud-native/dp/1803248122), second edition by Packt, this is the [repo here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-Microservices-with-Dapr-and-.NET-Second-Edition)!
- ðŸ”­  Working on my Home Assistant configuration --- planning to write some posts on it, coming soon! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - email or [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidebedin/) is absolutely fine
